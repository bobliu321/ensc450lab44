***** !! NOTE !! *****

CTS treats D-pins and I/O pins as non-synchronous pins by default.
If you want to change the behavior, you need to use the SetDPinAsSync
or SetIoPinAsSync statement in the clock tree specification file,
or use the setCTSMode -traceDPinAsLeaf {true|false} command,
or use the setCTSMode -traceIoPinAsLeaf {true|false} command
before specifyClockTree command.

**Info: In 11.1, the new grid-based RC model is used for extraction of parasitic extraction during Pre-Route and Clk-Route-Only analysis mode of CTS. If you save a design in EDI 10.1 and restore it in EDI 11.1, you will expect to see different timing results for Pre-Route and Clk-Route-Only mode. To revert to the old behavior EDI in 11.1, do 'setCTSMode -rcCorrelationAutoMode false' before clock tree synthesis or reporting.
