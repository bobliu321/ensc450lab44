Selected [260] pin for spreading. Could not spread (10 out of 260) pins because of constraints on the selected pins or because of some blockage (pin blockage, routing blockage, power stripes etc.) on the selected region.

Following pins are not spread:
  reset
  clock
  empty
  load
  key[0]
  plain[123]
  plain[124]
  plain[125]
  plain[126]

CTS treats D-pins and I/O pins as non-synchronous pins by default.
If you want to change the behavior, you need to use the SetDPinAsSync
or SetIoPinAsSync statement in the clock tree specification file,
or use the setCTSMode -traceDPinAsLeaf {true|false} command,
or use the setCTSMode -traceIoPinAsLeaf {true|false} command
before specifyClockTree command.

**Info: In 11.1, the new grid-based RC model is used for extraction of parasitic extraction during Pre-Route and Clk-Route-Only analysis mode of CTS. If you save a design in EDI 10.1 and restore it in EDI 11.1, you will expect to see different timing results for Pre-Route and Clk-Route-Only mode. To revert to the old behavior EDI in 11.1, do 'setCTSMode -rcCorrelationAutoMode false' before clock tree synthesis or reporting.

**WARN: (IMPEXT-3493):	The design extraction status has been reset by set_analysis_view/update_rc_corner or setExtractRCMode  command. The parasitic data can be regenerated either by extracting the design using the extractRC command or by loading the SPEF or RCDB file(s).
